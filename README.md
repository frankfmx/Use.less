Use.less
========

Easy to use utility mixins, variables and constants for use by less css. supports css3

This project seeks to streamline and possibly standardize variable and mixin usage among the LESS user communuty. 
It's a simple list of variables, constants and mixins that are constantly used by web designers. 

A simple example is '.abs();' This simple call replaces 'position: absolute;'. [.abs(){position: absolute;}]
another example is '.hide();' replacing 'display:none;' and '@uni50;' replacing 'rgba(50,50,50);'

Hopefully, very soon, myself or someone will start work on a version for SASS.

LESS is MORE!!!
